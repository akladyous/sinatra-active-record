        "Built a full-stack todo management application using Sinatra and ActiveRecord, exposing a RESTful JSON API consumed by a React frontend for task creation, updates, and filtering.",
        "Designed relational data models and associations (users, todos, categories, statuses) with ActiveRecord to enforce data integrity and consistent task ownership.",
        "Applied backend security controls including input validation, password constraints, CORS configuration, and parameterized queries to reduce common web application risks.",
        "Integrated a responsive React and Bootstrap UI to visualize task status, progress, and time-based filters while keeping business logic isolated in the API layer."
